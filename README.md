##### 2. About project 
By the [statics from RBK](https://www.rbc.ru/life/news/67c701169a79471c14b76fa5) (on of the most influential media in the Russia), in 2024, scammers stole more 295 billion rubles by the internet. This number is equal with budget of my native republic (Russia, Tatarstan).
I think, that you usually hear on TV news about problem of internet scammers. Unfortunatelly, this problem can affect all of us, so, I think, nowadays this problem potentionaly is on of the most important.

I know, that it is absurdly to solve this problem by the harassmenting them in internet, because they have powerful encryption technologies.
